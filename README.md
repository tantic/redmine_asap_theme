# Redmine ASAP Theme

This plugin try to propose a new UX/UI for Redmine with new tools like Stimulus/Turbo and Tailwindcss (one day Hotwire :-)).
The first version started almost from a blank page by replacing all Redmine pages. It works but it's not enought progressive.
This version start from the original theme so all pages works (normally) and the theme can be used now.

* Status : first version usable but need to be used and improved (feedback appreciated)
* Compatibility : work for Redmine >=6 (other versions not tested)

If you want to test it quickly with docker, you can use the repo https://github.com/tantic/redmine_asap_docker.git
